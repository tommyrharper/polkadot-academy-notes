# Collective Decision Making

collective decisions relate to governance.

- gather opinions
- aggregates preferences concisely
- a way to reach a decision as a collective

## Why?

- creates strong institutions
- agile decision making mechanisms support adaptation and survival due to external changes
- blockchain is highly automated but remains a human collective
- requires well designed decision-making mechanisms to ensure strength and longevity
- blockchain is bringing innovations and renewed interest in the theory of collective decision making


## Blockchain applications

- who participates in consensus
- how are new functions and policies decided upon

## Examples of mechanics

- Dictator or king (unelected)
- Tyrant (elected)
- Random dictator: select a person at random and let them make the decision
- Unelected committee (zurich guilds)
- Elected committee (representative democracy)
- Vote delegation (.eg. to political parties or people)
- Direct democracy: everybody participates in every decision

## Goals

There are 3 goals:
- Utility
  - decision maximizes society's welfare
  - it represent well the people's preferences
- Legitimacy
  - decision is fair
  - people trust the process and feel empowered by it
- Practicality
  - process is simple to understand
  - it is fast

## Direct Democracy

This is slow, in the case of emergency, the practicality of the goal becomes more relevant.

It also does not maximize utility.

**Paradox of voting:** The costs of voting exceed the expected benefit, due to the cost of becoming informed. The chance that you are the voter that changes the final decision is practically zero

### Rational ignorance

It is ration to learn about something if the benefit of not learning it is not worth the energy invested into learning it.

## Solution to the voting paradox

- **Representative democracy**: elect a committee
- **Delegated voting (liquid democracy)**: give your votes to other people who know the issue better

## Mechanism Capture

A dictator also doesn't maximize utility.

Special interest is prioritized oer the interests of the majority.

## Blockchain Security

- Validators are critical for governance (PoW, PoS etc.)
- Consensus  security requires that a supermajority of them are honest.
- Honest behavior is a Nash equilibrium, **unless** sufficient validators coordinate an attack
- A large enough group of validators may turn **adversarial**
- Therefor the security goal consists of minimizing the chance of **capture** of the validator set

## Recap

- Main gaols are utility, legitimacy and practically

## Voting Mechanisms

- One of the most popular types of collective decision making nowadays.
- There are *candidates* to choose from: people, policies, goods, etc.
- There are voters who declare *preferences* through *ballots*.
- A mechanism takes these ballots as inputs, and outputs a single candidate as the *winner*.
- Lots of *criteria* to judge these mechanisms.

### Types

- Single-vote
- Ranked-vote
- Vote splitting, strategic voting.
- Monotonicity and participation criteria.
- Condorcet winner and Condorcet criterion
- Arrow's impossibility theorem

## Single-vote mechanisms

- Plurality
- two-round
- instant run-off

## Voting Mechanisms

Different mechanisms cause multiple different outcomes.

Vote splitting: two similar candidates share a share of votes.

**Condorcet winner** A candidate who would win head to head against any other candidate.

- Tournament Graph w/ Net Arcs
  - candidate is a node
  - edges are votes between 1 v 1 standoffs

## Recap

- No voting mechanism is perfect
- Borda count and ranked-pairs are arguably more fair (but complex)
