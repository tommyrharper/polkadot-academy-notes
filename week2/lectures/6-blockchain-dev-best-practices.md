# Best Practices

- Test in adversarial conditions
- When a real product is out there it will be highly value bearing
  - Hence there will be high incentives to attack it
  - But testnets are not enough as they don't incentivise hackers
    - The tokenization and game theoretic aspect is different in testnet to a real value bearing environment
